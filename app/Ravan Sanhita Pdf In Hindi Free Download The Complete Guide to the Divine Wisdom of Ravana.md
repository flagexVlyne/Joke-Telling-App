According to some legends, Ravan Sanhita was written by Ravan himself, who was a great devotee of Lord Shiva and a master of various arts and sciences. He acquired this knowledge from Shiva after performing severe penance and pleasing him with his devotion. He compiled his wisdom in several books and hid them in different places in Lanka. After his death, some of these books were recovered by his brother Vibhishan, who took them to Ayodhya and gave them to Lord Rama. Others were lost or destroyed over time.
 
According to other legends, Ravan Sanhita was written by Shiva's disciples, who were inspired by Ravan's teachings and achievements. They collected his sayings and stories and composed them in a poetic form. They also added their own insights and experiences to enrich the text. Some of these disciples were Nandi, Ganesh, Kartikeya, Parvati, and others.
