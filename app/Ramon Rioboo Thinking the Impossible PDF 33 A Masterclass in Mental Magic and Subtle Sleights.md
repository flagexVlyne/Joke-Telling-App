- **Misdirection and Psychology**: A section devoted to explaining Rioboo's approach to misdirection, which involves creating moments of emotional or intellectual distraction that allow him to execute secret actions without suspicion.
- **Super Telepathy for Skeptics**: A stunning demonstration of mind reading using a memorized deck and a clever principle that allows the magician to know the identity and position of any card named by a spectator.
- **Asmodeus**: A devilish effect in which the magician predicts the outcome of a game of chance involving three dice and a deck of cards.
- **James Bonded**: A spectacular card revelation using a special card that can be examined by the spectator.
- **The Treated Card**: A versatile gimmick that Rioboo invented and uses for several effects in the book. It is a card that can be folded, torn, or cut without damaging it, and can be restored in an instant.

The book is well written and illustrated with clear diagrams and photos. It also includes an introduction by Juan Tamariz, who praises Rioboo's magic as "the birth of amazement through subtlety". The book is suitable for intermediate to advanced magicians who are interested in exploring new ideas and concepts in card magic.
