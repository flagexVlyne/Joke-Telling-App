If you want to learn more about how to play Monopoly Deal, you can check out the official rules reference cards that come with the game or watch some online tutorials on YouTube. The basic rules are simple: each player starts with 5 cards and draws 2 cards at the beginning of their turn. They can then play up to 3 cards from their hand, either as money, properties, or actions. Money cards are used to pay rent or debts to other players. Property cards are used to build your property sets and collect rent from other players. Action cards are used to perform various actions, such as stealing properties, swapping cards, or forcing other players to pay you.
 
The game ends when one player has 3 full property sets of different colors on the table. A full property set consists of 2-4 cards of the same color, depending on the property. For example, a full set of brown properties consists of 2 cards, while a full set of green properties consists of 4 cards. The player who collects 3 full property sets first wins the game.
 
Monopoly Deal is a game of strategy and luck, where you have to balance your money, properties, and actions wisely. You also have to be careful of other players who may try to steal your cards or sabotage your plans. You can use action cards to defend yourself or attack others, but be prepared for some surprises and twists along the way. Monopoly Deal is a game that will keep you on your toes and make you laugh, cry, and scream with joy or frustration.
