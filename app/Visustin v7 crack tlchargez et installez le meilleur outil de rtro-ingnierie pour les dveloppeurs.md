Visustin v7 can read your source code and create a flow chart that shows the logic and structure of your program. You can also edit the flow chart with Visustin Editor and customize its appearance. You can print the flow chart as a multi-page mosaic or export it to Visio or other formats[^1^].
 
## How to Use Visustin v7?
 
To use Visustin v7, you need to download and install it from the official website[^1^]. The installation process is simple and straightforward. After installation, you can launch Visustin v7 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
 
The main window of Visustin v7 consists of three parts: the menu bar, the toolbar and the workspace. The menu bar provides access to various commands and options. The toolbar contains buttons for common tasks such as opening files, saving charts and zooming. The workspace is where you can view and edit your flow charts.
 
To generate a flow chart from your source code, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the File menu and select Open Source File. Alternatively, you can click on the Open button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+O.
2. Browse to the location of your source code file and select it. You can also drag and drop your file into the workspace.
3. Visustin v7 will analyze your source code and create a flow chart in a few seconds. You can see the progress bar at the bottom of the window.
4. When the flow chart is ready, you can view it in the workspace. You can use the mouse wheel or the zoom buttons on the toolbar to adjust the size of the chart. You can also use the scroll bars or the arrow keys to move around the chart.
5. If you want to edit the flow chart, you can click on the Edit menu and select Edit Chart. Alternatively, you can click on the Edit button on the toolbar or press F2. This will open Visustin Editor where you can modify the shapes, colors and texts of your chart.
6. If you want to export your flow chart to another format such as Visio or HTML[^2^], you can click on the File menu and select Export Chart. Alternatively,
you can click on the Export button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+E. This will open a dialog box where you can choose your desired format and settings.
7. If you want to print your flow chart as a multi-page mosaic[^2^], you can click on
the File menu and select Print Chart. Alternatively,
you can click on
the Print button on
the toolbar or press Ctrl+P. This will open
a dialog box where you can adjust
your print options.

## Conclusion
 
Visustin v7 is a handy tool that can help you generate flow charts from your source code easily and quickly. It supports a wide range of programming languages and offers various features such as editing and exporting.
